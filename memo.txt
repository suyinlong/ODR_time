Create basic files (include get_hw_addrs.c and hw_addrs.h from Asgn3_code).

Caution: When compiling, several warnings will be prompted. The reason may be that libunp.a was built on 32-bit operating system but minix is running on 64-bit OS.

For simplicity, Please use np.h as project header file. Write all defines, structures and function declarations in it.
